turnin code:  cs_p3


Write a C/C++ program that enhances p1 by using pthreads to speedup
computing the minimum and maximum distances.  It will accept one
additional command-line argument which provides the number of threads
to create to compute the distances between points.

The mainline program should NOT participate in computing the distances.
Instead, it should create the required number of threads and wait for
them to complete the computation.
It should then print the final results (see required format below).

For N threads, you could have every Nth problem handled by the same thread.

For large problems, the pgm should be able to attain near-linear speedups.

--------

./p3 7 40000 1
8.705  16830.027
TIME 6.792571        ## for 1,2,4 threads it takes about 7,4,2 secs on system64

--------

alarm(90);   // <--- **** make this the first executable line of your program

cc -Ofast -o p3 p3.c -lm -lpthread   ##  -Ofast  *** should be used in makefile
    ^ that is the capital letter O and not the digit 0

time1    // copy this function from the timedemo.c file to get time to print

Performance counts.

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
        tar cvf p3.tar ./p3dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, I will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p3
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p3.
