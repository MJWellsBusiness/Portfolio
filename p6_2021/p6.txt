                                 Fall 2021


turnin code:  cs_p6


Have your main program do this:

    alarm(90);
    siggy();         // linked from our public directory (see below)
    while ( ! done)  // done is a global flag init'd to false
        sleep(1);

Each time the program receives any of these signals:
    SIGHUP
    SIGTERM
    SIGUSR1
    SIGUSR2
it should print:
    received SIGxxxx  where xxxx is replaced by the name of the signal.

For SIGTERM, in addition to the print above, the handler should arrange 
for the program to terminate with return code 222.

At the end, your program should print:
    HANDLED  usr1 A  usr2 B  hup C  term D
where A, B, C, D  are replaced by the number of type of signal that
you handled.
Also, print:
    TOTAL HANDLED N
where N is replaced by the total number of signals handled.

Your program should link with a function named siggy from:
    /nfshome/rbutler/public/courses/cs/p6siggy.o

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p6dir:
	tar cvf p6.tar ./p6dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p6
        rm -f *.o   ######   will also remove a local siggy.o
        make
    This should build an executable named p6 as described above.
